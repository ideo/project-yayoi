            Kids, like adults, have different personalities, sometimes called temperaments.
            Some kids are quiet and shy, while others are more outgoing. Some kids get excited about new experiences
            while
            others are more careful and cautious. Every child is different.
            It might be time to worry when your child’s behavior is <strong>out of the ordinary for them.</strong>
